# Motivation for `ggtibble`

From time to time, having a list of ggplots and being able to work on them like
a regular ggplot can be very helpful.  For example, when writing a report, you
may want to make a set of figures to separate out various levels of a group,
then make separate figures for each group.

# Introduction

The `ggtibble` package has two main functions to create sets of figures,
`ggtibble()` and `gglist()`.  These create a tibble with optional labels per
figure and captions (for `ggtibble()`) or a simpler list of figures (for
`gglist()`).

Both `ggtibble` and `gglist` objects can have ggplot geoms, facets, labels, and
lists of those added to them as though they were normal ggplot objects.  And,
you can add a `gglist` to either a `ggtibble` or a `gglist`.

# Typical use

Typical use will load required libraries, setup your plot data, generate the
plot, and then `knit_print()` it.

When generating the plot:

1. Give your dataset,
2. Indicate your columns for plotting using the `aes()` mapping as for any ggplot2 object,
3. Provide the `outercols` which are columns outside your dataset; one plot will
   be generated for each unique level of your data with the `outercols`.  Note
   that you cannot use `outercols` columns within the plot, but you will use
   them for captions and labels.
4. You can give a `caption` with a `glue::glue_data()` specification where valid
   columns are any column names that are in your `outercols` specification.  (If
   you don't give a caption, then it will be an empty string, `""`.)
5. You can give a list of labels which are each processed the same as the
   caption via `glue::glue_data()` and then passed to `labs()`.
6. After the plot is setup in ways that are specific to `ggtibble`, use it like
   a normal ggplot object adding geoms, etc.

```{r typical, fig.cap=all_plots$caption}
# Note, add `fig.cap=all_plots$caption` to show the generated caption for the
# figures

library(ggtibble)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

d_plot <-
  mtcars |>
  mutate(
    dispu = "cu. in."
  )
all_plots <-
  ggtibble(
    d_plot,
    aes(x = disp, y = hp),
    outercols = c("cyl", "dispu"),
    caption = "Horsepower by displacement for {cyl} cars",
    labs = list(x = "Displacement ({dispu})", y = "Gross horsepower")
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()

# The result is a tibble with columns for the `data_plot`, `figure`, and
# `caption`
as_tibble(all_plots)

# You can then show all the figures with the `knit_print()` method.
knit_print(all_plots)
```
